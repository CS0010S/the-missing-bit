# The Missing Bit
The Missing Bit is a small effort to help students pick up practical computing skills that they need for NUS and for the IT/SE life.

The modes of debate are issues, branches and pull requests.

# Some Rules
1. Don't follow rules if you don't want to
2. Humour matters, this course material should be a bit of fun to follow and learn from
3. We don't need everything; we just need enough (but we absolutely need healthy NUS memes and humour)
4. Simple is almost always better, except when it comes to your intelligence
5. This should be a gift from students to students

# Structure
Three main mods cover the stuff needed for semester 2 (and beyond):

- [Mod 1 - Command & Control](./mod_1_command_&_control.md)
- [Mod 2 - A Taste of Text Editing](./mod_2_a_taste_of_text_editing.md)
- [Mod 3 - Managing Change](./mod_3_managing_change.md)

Each mod is broken into smaller units.

# Format
- Podcast / campfire short videos for each unit. 2-3 students chatting about the unit, concepts, commands etc
- Companion website (github.io) with enough client-side magic to make it snazzy
- Code along script for students to follow
- Simple self-directed tasks to test grasp of concepts
- External resources

# Getting help
Not sure here, maybe an open Telegram for questions or tips. Whatever is least effort / least friction for students.
